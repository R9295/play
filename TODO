x. add field 'opendota verified' to model user which is a BooleanField that explains if the user has registered with opendota or not,
as parsing can only begin after they've verified with opendota.

x. Make sure users know to visit opendota to get their matches parsed if they aren't seeing their latest ones.

x. Find a way to test parser's delete_old_matches function( idea: remove the first match from the json response for the first parse run
and run it again to make it seem as if the match was new )
